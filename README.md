This Coursework was a way to teach the fundamentals of Natural Language Processing, and what goes into the full pipeline, from tokenising plaintext, to outputting a class. This code contains various different tokenisation methods, multiple methods for extracting significant phrases from a piece of text, stemming/lemmatising tokens, etc.
The words and phrases that are kept after cutting off the most and least common are weighted in each category (positive/negative film review) from the training data and fitted to an out-of-the-box Naive Bayes classifier, as well as my own classifier for comparison.
